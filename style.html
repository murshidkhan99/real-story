        <p>When a girl is skinny, and calls you late at night, and you glance at
the calendar, and it is four days before you are scheduled to get married,
and the girl you are marrying is not the skinny girl but another
girl, a girl who has already departed for the city where your wedding
is to be held, it is your job, most probably, to hang up the phone.
When you do not hang up the phone, you have not done your job.
When you invite that skinny girl to your apartment, and then you
jump into the shower so that you will be clean, taking special trouble
to wash the parts that matter, and then you mess up your hair so that
you will look as though you haven’t gone to any special trouble, then `</p>

          <p>The teacher was afraid.
And the children were afraid. All except Johnny. He watched the classroom door with hate. He felt the hatred deep within
his stomach. It gave him strength. It was two minutes to nine.
The teacher glanced numbly from the door and stared at the flag, which stood in a corner of the room. But she couldn't
see the flag today. She was blinded by her terror, not only for herself but mostly for them, her children. She had never had
children of her own. She had never married.
In the mists of her mind she saw the rows upon rows of children she had taught through her years. Their faces were
legion. But she could distinguish no one face. Only the same face, which varied but slightly. Always the same age or
thereabout. Seven. Perhaps a boy, perhaps a girl. And the face always open and ready for the knowledge that she was to
give. The same face staring at her, open, waiting and full of trust.
The children rustled, watching her, wondering what possessed her. They saw not the gray hair and the old eyes and the
lined face and the well-worn clothes. They saw only their teacher and the twisting her hands. Johnny looked away from
the door and watched with the other children. He did not understand anything except that the teacher was afraid, and
because she was afraid she was making them all worse and he wanted to shout that there was no need to fear. “Just
because they've conquered us there's no need for panic-fear,” Dad had said. “Don't be afraid, Johnny. If you fear too
much, you'll be dead even though you're alive.</p>
